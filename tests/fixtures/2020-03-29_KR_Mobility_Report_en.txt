COVID-19 Community Mobility Report

South Korea March 29, 2020
Mobility changes
Google prepared this report to help you and public health officials understand responses to social
distancing guidance related to COVID-19. This report shouldn’t be used for medical diagnostic,
prognostic, or treatment purposes. It also isn’t intended to be used for guidance on personal travel
plans.
Location accuracy and the understanding of categorized places varies from region to region, so we
don’t recommend using this data to compare changes between countries, or between regions with
different characteristics (e.g. rural versus urban areas).
We’ll leave a region out of the report if we don’t have statistically significant levels of data. To learn how
we calculate these trends and preserve privacy, read About this data.

About this data

Preserving privacy

These reports show how visits and length of
stay at different places change compared to
a baseline. We calculate these changes using
the same kind of aggregated and anonymized
data used to show popular times for places in
Google Maps.

These reports were developed to be helpful
while adhering to our stringent privacy
protocols and protecting people’s privacy. No
personally identifiable information, like an
individual’s location, contacts or movement, is
made available at any point.

Changes for each day are compared to a
baseline value for that day of the week:

Insights in these reports are created with
aggregated, anonymized sets of data from
users who have turned on the Location
History setting, which is off by default. People
who have Location History turned on can
choose to turn it off at any time from their
Google Account and can always delete
Location History data directly from their
Timeline.

●

The baseline is the median value, for the
corresponding day of the week, during the 5week period Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020.

●

The reports show trends over several
weeks with the most recent data representing
approximately 2-3 days ago—this is how long
it takes to produce the reports.
What data is included in the calculation
depends on user settings, connectivity, and
whether it meets our privacy threshold. If the
privacy threshold isn’t met (when somewhere
isn’t busy enough to ensure anonymity) we
don’t show a change for the day.
We include categories that are useful to
social distancing efforts as well as access to
essential services.
We calculate these insights based on data
from users who have opted-in to Location
History for their Google Account, so the data
represents a sample of our users. As with all
samples, this may or may not represent the
exact behavior of a wider population.

These reports are powered by the same
world-class anonymization technology that
we use in our products every day and that
keep your activity data private and secure.
These reports use differential privacy, which
adds artificial noise to our datasets enabling
high quality results without identifying any
individual person. These privacy-preserving
protections also ensure that the absolute
number of visits isn’t shared.
